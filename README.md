# E-Commerce Project

This is a full-stack e-commerce application named E-Commerce Client, built with React for the frontend and Node.js (Express) for the backend. It provides features like user authentication, product management, and more.

## Features

### Frontend
- React-based SPA with routing, state management, and shared context.
- Responsive and modern design using CSS.

### Backend
- RESTful API built with Express.
- Email functionality using NodeMailer.
- Relational database with MySQL.
- Middleware for handling cross-origin requests (CORS) and parsing incoming request data (Body-Parser).

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Express:** Backend framework for creating APIs.
- **Body-Parser:** Middleware for parsing incoming request data.
- **NodeMailer:** Email functionality for user communications.
- **MySQL:** Relational database for storing application data.
- **CORS:** Middleware for handling cross-origin requests.

### Frontend
- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router Dom:** For routing between pages.
- **useState & useContext:** React hooks for managing state.
- **Redux:** For centralized state management (e.g., email context).
- **CSS:** Styling framework for modern designs.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.

## Notes

- All project dependencies are defined in the respective package.json files.
- Ensure to synchronize your database schema with the backend API.
